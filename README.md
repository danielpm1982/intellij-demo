[**Description of this repository**]<br>
This is a sample Java project created for demonstrating JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate.<br>
The many versions of this project can be found at each branch (each branch having a different stage of this project evolution). At the master branch you'll only find the last version yet created.<br>
This project was created for my course "IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate: How to Install and Test It on Linux", which you can find at the following YouTube link:<br>

This repository is a single-project repo with Git version control.

Some of my repositories are for backup only, each of them being a collection of tens of projects inside one same repo (with no individual version control for each project), and others are single-project repositores (with effective version control for that single project). As a distinction between them, the backup repos are named in uppercase with underscores (e.g. SPRING3) while the single-project ones are named in lowercase with dashes (e.g. springboot2-ac-di).
